### Aim of making the project
* To learn Unity3D engine.

### Languages Used
* C# - C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its.NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma in 2002 and ISO in 2003. Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
